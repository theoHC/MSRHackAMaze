# Maze Solver
This repository generates and solves a hexagonal maze. Two planning algorithms, wavefront and recursive backtracking, are implemented. The maze is generated using Prim's algorithm.

## Planning Algorithms :
* [Wavefront Planner](https://nu-msr.github.io/hackathon/wavefront.html)
* [Recursive Back Tracing](https://nu-msr.github.io/hackathon/recursive_backtrack.html)

## Maze Generation Algorithm :
* [Random Prim's Generation](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/10/maze-generation-prim-s-algorithm)

This project was built as a part of the [Python Challenge](https://nu-msr.github.io/hackathon/python_challenge.html) of MSR Hackathon '25 @Northwestern University.
